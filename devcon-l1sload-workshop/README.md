## L1SLOAD Workshop

**L1SLOAD is a precompile that allows your L2 dapp to use L1 (Ethereum) data**

What L1SLOAD unlocks:

- Write normal Solidity code to get direct read access to L1 state from your L2 contract.
- Developer-friendly building block for better L1/L2 interoperability.

## Documentation

This repository contains the resources which are covered in the [L1SLOAD Workshop](https://app.devcon.org/schedule/ERQ7N3) during Devcon:

**Part 1**: Includes simple examples to get started. It also shows L1SLOAD utility contracts for configuring a local test environment in Foundry.

**Part 2**: Explore various examples demonstrating how to interact with different data types and structures in Solidity.

**Part 3**: Dive into a real-world use case by exploring [Keystore](https://scroll.io/blog/towards-the-wallet-endgame-with-keystore).
